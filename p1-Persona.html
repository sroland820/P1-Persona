My name is Sammie and I'm a senior at EWU. Besides my incredible knack for being insanely sarcastic, I am also very shy and wouldn't mind never talking to anyone ever again. I already have my full time job as an in-house graphic designer for my church and I love every second of it. Also, I am a giant nerdy cliche and I don't care who knows it.
